### For all QUERY_TYPEs

Identify from the ACTUAL RESEARCH OUTPUT:
- **PROMPT FORMAT** - Does research recommend JSON, structured params, natural language, keywords?
- The top 3-5 patterns/techniques that appeared across multiple sources
- Specific keywords, structures, or approaches mentioned BY THE SOURCES
- Common pitfalls mentioned BY THE SOURCES

---

## THEN: Show Summary + Invite Vision

**Display in this EXACT sequence:**

**Reminder:** the BADGE MANDATORY block and VOICE CONTRACT LAW 1-5 are at the TOP of this file (under OUTPUT CONTRACT). If you are about to synthesize and those rules are not in your active context, scroll back up and re-read them. Every canonical-compliance failure in v3.0.6 and v3.0.7 traced to the LAWs being too deep in the file to stay in context at emission time. They are no longer deep.

---

**FIRST - What I learned (based on QUERY_TYPE):**

**If RECOMMENDATIONS** - Show specific things mentioned with sources:
```
🏆 Most mentioned:

[Tool Name] - {n}x mentions
Use Case: [what it does]
Sources: @handle1, @handle2, r/sub, blog.com

[Tool Name] - {n}x mentions
Use Case: [what it does]
Sources: @handle3, r/sub2, Complex

Notable mentions: [other specific things with 1-2 mentions]
```

**CRITICAL for RECOMMENDATIONS:**
- Each item MUST have a "Sources:" line with actual @handles from X posts (e.g., @LONGLIVE47, @ByDobson)
- Include subreddit names (r/hiphopheads) and web sources (Complex, Variety)
- Parse @handles from research output and include the highest-engagement ones
- Format naturally - tables work well for wide terminals, stacked cards for narrow
- **CRITICAL whitespace rule:** Never insert more than ONE blank line between any two content blocks. Comparison tables should immediately follow the preceding paragraph with exactly one blank line. Do NOT pad with 3-6 empty lines before tables.

**If PROMPTING/NEWS/GENERAL** - Show synthesis and patterns:

CITATION RULE: Cite sources sparingly to prove research is real.
- In the "What I learned" intro: cite 1-2 top sources total, not every sentence
- In KEY PATTERNS: cite 1 source per pattern, short format: "per @handle" or "per r/sub"
- Do NOT include engagement metrics in citations (likes, upvotes) - save those for stats box
- Do NOT chain multiple citations: "per @x, @y, @z" is too much. Pick the strongest one.

**URL formatting is governed by LAW 8** in the VOICE CONTRACT block above. Every citation in the narrative body is an inline markdown link `[name](url)`; raw URL strings are forbidden; plain-text fallback only when the raw data has no URL for that specific source. Re-read LAW 8 now if you skipped it. The stats footer is engine-emitted per LAW 5 and passes through verbatim.

CITATION PRIORITY (most to least preferred), with each example showing the LAW 8 inline-link shape:
1. @handles from X - `per [@handle](https://x.com/handle)` (these prove the tool's unique value)
2. r/subreddits from Reddit - `per [r/subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/subreddit)` (when citing Reddit, YouTube, or TikTok, prefer quoting top comments over just the thread title)
3. YouTube channels - `per [channel name](https://youtube.com/@channel) on YouTube` (transcript-backed insights)
4. TikTok creators - `per [@creator](https://tiktok.com/@creator) on TikTok` (viral/trending signal)
5. Instagram creators - `per [@creator](https://instagram.com/creator) on Instagram` (influencer/creator signal)
6. HN discussions - `per [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=N)` or `per [hn/username](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=username)` (developer community signal)
7. Polymarket - `[Polymarket](https://polymarket.com/event/...) has X at Y% (up/down Z%)` with specific odds and movement
8. Web sources - ONLY when Reddit/X/YouTube/TikTok/Instagram/HN/Polymarket don't cover that specific fact; link the publication: `per [Rolling Stone](https://rollingstone.com/...)`

The tool's value is surfacing what PEOPLE are saying, not what journalists wrote.
When both a web article and an X post cover the same fact, cite the X post.

(These narrative examples illustrate LAW 8 from the VOICE CONTRACT.)

**BAD:** "His album is set for March 20 (per Rolling Stone; Billboard; Complex)."
**GOOD:** "His album BULLY drops March 20 - fans on X are split on the tracklist, per [@honest30bgfan_](https://x.com/honest30bgfan_)"
**GOOD:** "Ye's apology got massive traction on [r/hiphopheads](https://reddit.com/r/hiphopheads)"
**OK** (web, only when Reddit/X don't have it): "The Hellwatt Festival runs July 4-18 at RCF Arena, per [Billboard](https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/hellwatt-festival-2026-lineup-...)"

**Lead with people, not publications.** Start each topic with what Reddit/X
users are saying/feeling, then add web context only if needed. The user came
here for the conversation, not the press release.

**MANDATORY - bold headline per narrative paragraph.** Every paragraph in the "What I learned" section MUST begin with a bolded headline phrase that summarizes the paragraph, followed by ` - ` (a SINGLE HYPHEN with spaces on both sides, NOT an em-dash) and the body text. Pattern: `**Headline phrase** - body text describing what people are saying...`. Without the bold headline, the output is unscannable slop.

**NEVER use em-dashes (`—`) or en-dashes (`–`) anywhere in your response.** Use ` - ` (single hyphen with spaces) instead. Em-dashes are the most reliable AI-slop tell; a response with em-dashes reads as generated. This applies to synthesis body, headline separators, KEY PATTERNS list, and the invitation section. The only exception is quoted content where the source used an em-dash.

**NEVER use `##` or `###` markdown section headers in your response body.** No `## The launch`, no `## Where it disappoints`, no `## Polymarket`, no `## Best quotes`, no `## Stats snapshot`. Those read as AI-slop news-article structure. The narrative is a short block of bold-lead-in paragraphs followed by a prose label `KEY PATTERNS from the research:` followed by a numbered list. That is the only structure.

**NEVER write a title line at the top of your response.** No `Kanye West: last 30 days`, no `Claude Opus 4.7 - what people are actually saying`, no `{Topic} news`. Your response begins with the MANDATORY badge on line 1, one blank line, then the prose label `What I learned:` on line 3, and goes straight into the narrative.

```
🌐 last30days v{VERSION} · synced {YYYY-MM-DD}

What I learned:

**{Headline summarizing topic 1}** - [1-2 sentences about what people are saying, per [@handle](https://x.com/handle) or [r/sub](https://reddit.com/r/sub)]

**{Headline summarizing topic 2}** - [1-2 sentences, per [@handle](https://x.com/handle) or [r/sub](https://reddit.com/r/sub)]

**{Headline summarizing topic 3}** - [1-2 sentences, per [@handle](https://x.com/handle) or [r/sub](https://reddit.com/r/sub)]

KEY PATTERNS from the research:
1. [Pattern] - per [@handle](https://x.com/handle)
2. [Pattern] - per [r/sub](https://reddit.com/r/sub)
3. [Pattern] - per [@handle](https://x.com/handle)
```

At render time the `@handle`, `r/sub`, and publication-name placeholders become markdown links wrapping the actual handle/sub/name, with the URL pulled from the raw research dump. Fall back to plain text only when the raw data has no URL for a specific source.

Headlines should be specific and newsy ("BULLY dropped and it's dominating", "Europe is banning him one country at a time"), not generic ("Album release", "Tour updates").

**THEN - Quality Nudge (if present in the output):**

If the research output contains a `**🔍 Research Coverage:**` block, render it verbatim right before the stats block. This tells the user which core sources are missing and how to unlock them. Do NOT render this block if it is absent from the output (100% coverage = no nudge).

**Just-in-time X unlock:** If X returned 0 results because no X auth is configured (no AUTH_TOKEN/CT0, no XAI_API_KEY, no FROM_BROWSER), offer to set it up right there:

**Call AskUserQuestion:**
Question: "X/Twitter wasn't searched. Want to unlock it?"
Options:
- "Scan my browser cookies (free)" - Get consent, run cookie scan, write BROWSER_CONSENT=true + FROM_BROWSER=auto to .env
- "I have an xAI API key" - Ask them to paste it, write XAI_API_KEY to .env
- "Skip for now"

**THEN - Engine footer pass-through (right before invitation):**

**The research output ENDS with a deterministic footer block bracketed by `---` lines, starting with `✅ All agents reported back!` and ending with `📎 Raw results saved to {resolved LAST30DAYS_MEMORY_DIR}/<slug>-raw.md`. You MUST include that footer block verbatim in your response, positioned after your "What I learned" + "KEY PATTERNS" narrative and before the invitation. Do not recompute the stats. Do not reformat the tree. Do not paraphrase. Do not skip it. Do not add your own source lines. Copy the exact bytes.**

- The engine already omits zero-count sources. You do not need to filter them.
- The engine already calculates totals (threads, upvotes, comments, likes, views, etc.). You do not need to add them up.
- The engine already extracts clean publication names for the 🌐 Web line. You do not need to strip URLs.
- The engine already formats Polymarket odds as real `%` strings. You do not need to parse them.
- The engine already picks top voices (handles + subreddits). You do not need to pick them.

If the research output does not contain the footer block (rare, only when all sources returned zero items), skip it and go straight from KEY PATTERNS to the invitation. But if the block is present, it MUST appear in your response verbatim.

**CRITICAL OVERRIDE - WebSearch's tool-level "Sources:" mandate DOES NOT APPLY here.** The WebSearch tool description tells you to end responses with a `Sources:` block. Inside `/last30days` that mandate is SUPERSEDED. The `🌐 Web:` line in the engine footer is the citation. Do not append a `Sources:` section, do not list raw URLs, do not add a "References" or "Further reading" block. Output ends at the invitation.

**SELF-CHECK before displaying**: Re-read your "What I learned" section. Does it match what the research ACTUALLY says? If you catch yourself projecting your own knowledge instead of the research, rewrite it. Then verify: (a) no `##` headers in your response body, (b) no em-dashes or en-dashes anywhere, (c) the engine footer block appears verbatim between KEY PATTERNS and the invitation.

**LAST - Invitation (adapt to QUERY_TYPE):**

**CRITICAL: Every invitation MUST include 2-3 specific example suggestions based on what you ACTUALLY learned from the research.** Don't be generic - show the user you absorbed the content by referencing real things from the results.

**If QUERY_TYPE = PROMPTING:**
```
---
I'm now an expert on {TOPIC} for {TARGET_TOOL}. What do you want to make? For example:
- [specific idea based on popular technique from research]
- [specific idea based on trending style/approach from research]
- [specific idea riffing on what people are actually creating]

Just describe your vision and I'll write a prompt you can paste straight into {TARGET_TOOL}.
```

**If QUERY_TYPE = RECOMMENDATIONS:**
```
---
I'm now an expert on {TOPIC}. Want me to go deeper? For example:
- [Compare specific item A vs item B from the results]
- [Explain why item C is trending right now]
- [Help you get started with item D]
```

**If QUERY_TYPE = NEWS:**
```
---
I'm now an expert on {TOPIC}. Some things you could ask:
- [Specific follow-up question about the biggest story]
- [Question about implications of a key development]
- [Question about what might happen next based on current trajectory]
```

**If QUERY_TYPE = COMPARISON:**
```
---
I've compared {TOPIC_A} vs {TOPIC_B} using the latest community data. Some things you could ask:
- [Deep dive into {TOPIC_A} alone with /last30days {TOPIC_A}]
- [Deep dive into {TOPIC_B} alone with /last30days {TOPIC_B}]
- [Focus on a specific dimension from the comparison table]
- [Look at a different time period with --days=7 or --days=90]
```

**If QUERY_TYPE = GENERAL:**
```
---
I'm now an expert on {TOPIC}. Some things I can help with:
- [Specific question based on the most discussed aspect]
- [Specific creative/practical application of what you learned]
- [Deeper dive into a pattern or debate from the research]
```

**Example invitation (quality bar reference):**

For `/last30days kanye west` (GENERAL):
> I'm now an expert on Kanye West. Some things I can help with:
> - What's the real story behind the apology letter - genuine or PR move?
> - Break down the BULLY tracklist reactions and what fans are expecting
> - Compare how Reddit vs X are reacting to the Bianca narrative

Close with `I have all the links to the {N} {source list} I pulled from. Just ask.` where `{source list}` names only sources that returned results (e.g. "14 Reddit threads, 22 X posts, and 6 YouTube videos"). Never mention a source with 0 results.

---

## PRE-PRESENT SELF-CHECK - run before displaying the synthesis

**Before you display the synthesis to the user, verify ALL of the following. If any check fails AND the underlying data supports fixing it, regenerate the synthesis ONCE with the missing elements. If the data itself is absent (e.g., no Polymarket markets on this topic), skip that check silently.**

1. **Bold headlines present.** Every narrative paragraph in "What I learned" starts with `**Headline phrase** -` (single hyphen with spaces, NOT em-dash). If any paragraph opens with plain prose, regenerate with bold headlines.
2. **Per-source emoji headers in the stats footer.** Every active source returned by the engine has a `├─` or `└─` line with its emoji, counts, and engagement numbers. No active source is silently dropped; no source with 0 results is displayed.
3. **Quoted highlights where evidence supports them.** For YouTube items with transcripts and Reddit/X items with fun/highlight quotes, at least 2 verbatim quotes appear in the synthesis. Attributed to the channel/commenter/subreddit.
4. **Polymarket block present if markets were returned.** If the engine surfaced Polymarket markets, the synthesis includes specific percentages and directional movement. If no markets were surfaced, skip.
5. **Coverage footer matches the actual output.** `✅ All agents reported back!` line followed by per-source `├─`/`└─` tree exactly as the engine provided.
6. **NO trailing Sources section.** The output ends at the invitation ("I have all the links... Just ask."). Nothing below it. Not a `Sources:`, not a `References:`, not `Further reading:`, not any bulleted list of URLs or publication names. If you are about to emit one because WebSearch told you to - DO NOT. The 🌐 Web: line is the citation.
7. **Research protocol was followed.** On WebSearch platforms, the command you ran used `--emit=compact --plan 'QUERY_PLAN_JSON'` with resolved handles/subreddits/hashtags. If you took the degraded path (`--emit md`, no plan, no flags), the synthesis will almost certainly fail checks 1-3 - regenerate by returning to Step 0.55 and running the full protocol.

**Max ONE regeneration.** If the regenerated output still fails the self-check, display the best version you have and note to the user which check(s) the data could not satisfy, so they can re-run or adjust their query.

---

## SHAREABLE HTML BRIEF (when the user asked for one)

**This section fires if EITHER trigger is true:**

- `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--emit=html`, `--emit:html`, or `--html` as a flag
- The user's natural-language request asks for an HTML brief, shareable doc, or file for sharing (Slack, email, Notion, "export as HTML", etc). Use your judgment for phrasing variants.

**If neither trigger fires, skip this entire section and proceed to WAIT FOR USER'S RESPONSE.** No HTML save flow, no reference read needed.

**When triggered, you MUST:**

- Read `references/save-html-brief.md` **[MISSING — 该文件未随本仓库分发，见上游 mvanhorn/last30days-skill]** BEFORE proceeding to WAIT FOR USER'S RESPONSE
- Follow that file's instructions exactly - it is the canonical source for the save flow
- Append the confirmation line (`📎 Shareable brief saved to <path>`) to your already-emitted chat response

**You MUST NOT:**

- Improvise the HTML save flow from memory or from instructions you've seen before
- Skip the reference read because the steps "look familiar"
- Save to a different path than the reference specifies
- Add data quality warnings, debug headers, or safety notes to the saved HTML
- Re-research the topic for the HTML render - the engine cache covers the second invocation

**Why the directive is forceful:** the reference file is the only source of truth for the save flow. Skipping it produces broken artifacts - wrong path conventions, missing synthesis content, leaked engine debug output, or warnings that don't belong in shareable docs.

---

## WAIT FOR USER'S RESPONSE

**STOP and wait** for the user to respond. Do NOT call any tools after displaying the invitation. Do NOT append a `Sources:` section (see override above - WebSearch's mandate does not apply here). The research script already saved raw data to `LAST30DAYS_MEMORY_DIR` (defaults to `~/Documents/Last30Days`) via `--save-dir`.

---

## WHEN USER RESPONDS

**Read their response and match the intent:**

- If they ask a **QUESTION** about the topic → Answer from your research (no new searches, no prompt)
- If they ask to **GO DEEPER** on a subtopic → Elaborate using your research findings
- If they describe something they want to **CREATE** → Write ONE perfect prompt (see below)
- If they ask for a **PROMPT** explicitly → Write ONE perfect prompt (see below)
- If they say **"more fun"**, **"too serious"**, or similar → Write `FUN_LEVEL=high` to `~/.config/last30days/.env` (append, don't overwrite). Confirm: "Fun level set to high. Next run will surface more witty and viral content."
- If they say **"less fun"**, **"too many jokes"**, or similar → Write `FUN_LEVEL=low` to `~/.config/last30days/.env`. Confirm: "Fun level set to low. Next run will focus on the news."
- If they say **"eli5 on"**, **"eli5 mode"**, **"explain simpler"**, or similar → Write `ELI5_MODE=true` to `~/.config/last30days/.env`. Confirm: "ELI5 mode on. All future runs will explain things like you're 5."
- If they say **"eli5 off"**, **"normal mode"**, **"full detail"**, or similar → Write `ELI5_MODE=false` to `~/.config/last30days/.env`. Confirm: "ELI5 mode off. Back to full detail."

**Only write a prompt when the user wants one.** Don't force a prompt on someone who asked "what could happen next with Iran."

### Writing a Prompt

When the user wants a prompt, write a **single, highly-tailored prompt** using your research expertise.

### CRITICAL: Match the FORMAT the research recommends

**If research says to use a specific prompt FORMAT, YOU MUST USE THAT FORMAT.**

**ANTI-PATTERN**: Research says "use JSON prompts with device specs" but you write plain prose. This defeats the entire purpose of the research.

### Quality Checklist (run before delivering):
- [ ] **FORMAT MATCHES RESEARCH** - If research said JSON/structured/etc, prompt IS that format
- [ ] Directly addresses what the user said they want to create
- [ ] Uses specific patterns/keywords discovered in research
- [ ] Ready to paste with zero edits (or minimal [PLACEHOLDERS] clearly marked)
- [ ] Appropriate length and style for TARGET_TOOL

### Output Format:

```
Here's your prompt for {TARGET_TOOL}:

---

[The actual prompt IN THE FORMAT THE RESEARCH RECOMMENDS]

---

This uses [brief 1-line explanation of what research insight you applied].
```

---

## IF USER ASKS FOR MORE OPTIONS

Only if they ask for alternatives or more prompts, provide 2-3 variations. Don't dump a prompt pack unless requested.

---

## AFTER EACH PROMPT: Stay in Expert Mode

After delivering a prompt, offer to write more:

> Want another prompt? Just tell me what you're creating next.

---

## CONTEXT MEMORY

For the rest of this conversation, remember:
- **TOPIC**: {topic}
- **TARGET_TOOL**: {tool}
- **KEY PATTERNS**: {list the top 3-5 patterns you learned}
- **RESEARCH FINDINGS**: The key facts and insights from the research

**CRITICAL: After research is complete, treat yourself as an EXPERT on this topic.**

When the user asks follow-up questions:
- **DO NOT run new WebSearches** - you already have the research
- **Answer from what you learned** - cite the Reddit threads, X posts, and web sources
- **If they ask a question** - answer it from your research findings
- **If they ask for a prompt** - write one using your expertise

Only do new research if the user explicitly asks about a DIFFERENT topic.

---

## Output Summary Footer (After Each Prompt)

After delivering a prompt, end with:

```
