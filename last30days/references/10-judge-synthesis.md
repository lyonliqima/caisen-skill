## Judge Agent: Synthesize All Sources

### v3 Cluster-First Output

**v3 returns results grouped by STORY/THEME (clusters), not by source.** Each cluster represents one narrative thread found across multiple platforms.

**How to read v3 output:**
- `### 1. Cluster Title (score N, M items, sources: X, Reddit, TikTok)` - a story found across multiple platforms
- `Uncertainty: single-source` - only one platform found this story (lower confidence)
- `Uncertainty: thin-evidence` - all items scored below 55 (unconfirmed)
- Items within a cluster show: source label, title, date, score, URL, and evidence snippet

**Synthesis strategy for cluster-first output:**
1. **Synthesize per-cluster first.** Each cluster = one story. Summarize what each story is about.
2. **Multi-source clusters are highest confidence.** A cluster with items from Reddit + X + YouTube is much stronger than single-source.
3. **Check uncertainty tags.** "single-source" means treat with caution. "thin-evidence" means mention but caveat.
4. **Cross-cluster synthesis second.** After covering individual stories, identify themes that span clusters.
5. **Engagement signals still matter.** Items with high likes/upvotes/views within a cluster are the strongest evidence points.
6. **Quote directly from evidence snippets.** The snippets are pre-extracted best passages - use them.
7. Extract the top 3-5 actionable insights across all clusters.
8. **Disambiguation: trust your resolved entity.** When Step 0.55 resolved a specific entity (handles, subreddits, location context), prioritize content about THAT entity in your synthesis. If search results contain a different entity with the same name (e.g., a Spanish resort vs a WA athletic club both called "Bellevue Club"), lead with the entity your resolution identified. Mention the other only briefly, or not at all if the user clearly meant the resolved one. The resolved handles are the strongest signal for user intent.

### Source-Specific Guidance (still applies within clusters)

The Judge Agent must:
1. Weight Reddit/X sources HIGHER (they have engagement signals: upvotes, likes)
2. Weight YouTube sources HIGH (they have views, likes, and transcript content)
3. Weight TikTok sources HIGH (they have views, likes, and caption content - viral signal)
4. Weight WebSearch sources LOWER (no engagement data)
5. **For Reddit, YouTube, and TikTok: Pay special attention to top comments** - they often contain the wittiest, most insightful, or funniest take. Quote them directly, attributing to the commenter and including the vote count ("N upvotes" for Reddit, "N likes" for YouTube and TikTok). A top comment with thousands of votes is a stronger community signal than the parent post's stats alone.
6. **For YouTube: Quote transcript highlights AND top comments.** Transcript highlights capture the video's own words; top comments capture how viewers reacted. Both add value - use them together. Attribute transcript quotes to the channel name.
7. Identify patterns that appear across ALL sources (strongest signals)
8. Note any contradictions between sources
9. **Multi-source clusters (items from 3+ platforms) are the strongest signals.** Lead with these.
10. **For GitHub person-mode data:** When the output includes "GitHub Person Profile" items, these contain PR velocity, top repos with star counts, release notes, README summaries, and top issues. Lead with the velocity headline ("X PRs merged across Y repos"), then highlight the most impressive repos by star count. Weave release notes into the narrative to show what actually shipped. For own projects, mention top feature requests and complaints as community signal. The cross-source story is: "X is shipping Y (GitHub) while people on Z platform are saying W about it."
11. **For GitHub project-mode data:** When the output includes "GitHub project:" items, these have live star counts, README snippets, release notes, and top issues fetched directly from the API. Always prefer these numbers over star counts cited by blog posts, YouTube videos, or tweets. Live API data is authoritative. When items include "(live: NNK stars)" annotations, use those numbers.
12. **For GitHub star enrichment:** When candidates have `(live: NNK stars)` appended to their evidence, that number came from a post-research API check. It overrides whatever the original source claimed.

### Prediction Markets (Polymarket)

**CRITICAL: When Polymarket returns relevant markets, prediction market odds are among the highest-signal data points in your research.** Real money on outcomes cuts through opinion. Treat them as strong evidence, not an afterthought.

**How to interpret and synthesize Polymarket data:**

1. **Prefer structural/long-term markets over near-term deadlines.** Championship odds > regular season title. Regime change > near-term strike deadline. IPO/major milestone > incremental update. Presidency > individual state primary. When multiple markets exist, the bigger question is more interesting to the user.

2. **When the topic is an outcome in a multi-outcome market, call out that specific outcome's odds and movement.** Don't just say "Polymarket has a #1 seed market" - say "Arizona has a 28% chance of being the #1 overall seed, up 10% this month." The user cares about THEIR topic's position in the market.

3. **Weave odds into the narrative as supporting evidence.** Don't isolate Polymarket data in its own paragraph. Instead: "Final Four buzz is building - Polymarket gives Arizona a 12% chance to win the championship (up 3% this week), and 28% to earn a #1 seed."

4. **Citation format: show ONLY % odds. NEVER mention dollar volumes, liquidity, or betting amounts.** The % odds are the magic of Polymarket -- the dollar amounts are internal liquidity metrics that mean nothing to readers. Say "Polymarket has Arizona at 28% for a #1 seed (up 10% this month)" -- NOT "28% ($24K volume)". The dollar figure adds zero value and clutters the insight.

5. **When multiple relevant markets exist, highlight 3-5 of the most interesting ones** in your synthesis, ordered by importance (structural > near-term). Don't just pick the highest-volume one.

**Domain examples of market importance ranking:**
- **Sports:** Championship/tournament odds > conference title > regular season > weekly matchup
- **Geopolitics:** Regime change/structural outcomes > near-term strike deadlines > sanctions
- **Tech/Business:** IPO, major product launch, company milestones > incremental updates
- **Elections:** Presidency > primary > individual state

**Do NOT display stats here - they come at the end, right before the invitation.**

6. **Polymarket odds with real money behind them are STRONGER signals than opinions.** A $66K volume market with 96% odds is more reliable than 100 tweets. Always include specific percentages in the synthesis when Polymarket markets are confirmed relevant.

### X Reply Cluster Weighting

When you see a cluster of replies to a recommendation-request tweet (someone asking "what's the best X?" and getting multiple independent responses), call this out prominently. This is the strongest form of community endorsement - real people independently making the same recommendation without coordination. Example: "In a thread where @ecom_cork asked for Loom alternatives, every reply said Tella."

### WebSearch Supplement Weighting for Comparisons

For product comparison queries, WebSearch supplements (blog comparisons, review articles) should be weighted equally with social data. A detailed 2,000-word comparison article from Efficient App is more informative than 50 one-line tweets. Feature it in the synthesis.

## FIRST: Internalize the Research

**CRITICAL: Ground your synthesis in the ACTUAL research content, not your pre-existing knowledge.**

Read the research output carefully. Pay attention to:
- **Exact product/tool names** mentioned (e.g., if research mentions "ClawdBot" or "@clawdbot", that's a DIFFERENT product than "Claude Code" - don't conflate them)
- **Specific quotes and insights** from the sources - use THESE, not generic knowledge
- **What the sources actually say**, not what you assume the topic is about

**ANTI-PATTERN TO AVOID**: If user asks about "clawdbot skills" and research returns ClawdBot content (self-hosted AI agent), do NOT synthesize this as "Claude Code skills" just because both involve "skills". Read what the research actually says.

**FUN CONTENT: If the research output includes a "## Best Takes" section or items tagged with `fun:` scores, weave at least 2-3 of the funniest/cleverest quotes into your synthesis.** Reddit comments and X posts with high fun scores are the voice of the people. A 1,338-upvote comment that says "Where's the limewire link" tells you more about the cultural moment than a news article. Quote the actual text. Don't put fun content in a separate section - mix it into the narrative where it fits naturally. This is what makes the report feel alive rather than like a news summary.

**ELI5 MODE: If ELI5_MODE is true for this run, apply these writing guidelines to your ENTIRE synthesis. If ELI5_MODE is false, skip this block completely and write normally.**

ELI5 Mode: Explain it to me like I'm 5 years old.

- Assume I know nothing about this topic. Zero context.
- No jargon without a quick explanation in parentheses
- Short sentences. One idea per sentence.
- Start with the single most important thing that happened, in one line
- Use analogies when they help ("think of it like...")
- Keep the same structure: narrative, key patterns, stats, invitation
- Still quote real people and cite sources - don't lose the grounding
- Don't be condescending. Simple is not stupid. ELI5 means accessible, not childish.

Example - normal: "Arizona's identity is paint scoring (50%+ shooting, 9th nationally) and rebounding behind Big 12 Player of the Year Jaden Bradley."
Example - ELI5: "Arizona wins by being physical - they score most of their points close to the basket and they're one of the best shooting teams in the country."

Same data. Same sources. Just clearer.

### If QUERY_TYPE = RECOMMENDATIONS — Signal-weighted picks, not mention counts

**The failure mode for RECOMMENDATIONS queries is "counting when you should have judged."** Mention count rewards whatever is already popular, which is rarely what is actually recommended. Rank by signal quality instead.

**Signal weights (highest to lowest):**
1. **Practitioner testimony** (weight 5) - first-person "I use X and here's why" with specific reasoning, version numbers, or workflow details
2. **Expert defection / authority move** (weight 4) - a domain insider publicly switching, endorsing, or picking (e.g., Flask creator switching from Python to Go)
3. **Measurable claim** (weight 4) - specific number, benchmark, production adoption proof (e.g., "43.7% latency win", "LinkedIn and Uber running it in prod")
4. **Reasoned comparison** (weight 3) - side-by-side analysis with tradeoffs explicitly named
5. **Pattern across independent sources** (weight 2) - multiple unaffiliated voices converging on the same pick
6. **Descriptive mention** (weight 1) - "X is a Python framework" — existence, not recommendation
7. **Promotional / bootcamp / course-caption** (weight 0) - "comment CODE for my course" — skip entirely, do not count

**Before ranking, separate "what EXISTS" from "what is RECOMMENDED":**
- EXISTS = descriptive mentions, promotional content, training-data inertia, bootcamp curriculum, "learn X first" posts with no stakes attached
- RECOMMENDED = reasoned picks from voices with stakes in the outcome (practitioners, experts, case studies, people who switched)
- Only RECOMMENDED items drive the top of the ranking. Existing-but-not-recommended items go in "Also mentioned" at the bottom with a one-line note on why they are mentions not picks.

**Lead with the 30-day DELTA, not the status-quo baseline.** What is the interesting movement? Who is switching? What is the contrarian signal? A status-quo leader with no movement is a footer item, not the headline. "Python has 15 mentions" is not a delta; "Flask creator switched to Go this month" is.

**Output shape:**

```
🏆 Top recommendations (ranked by signal quality, not mention count):

**[Pick 1]** - [one-line why it is the top recommendation based on the strongest signal in the research]
- Evidence: [specific practitioner testimony, benchmark number, or expert pick - quote the actual signal]
- Best for: [specific use case]
- Voices: [real @handles, publications, or r/subreddits with stakes in the outcome]

**[Pick 2]** - [same shape]

**[Pick 3]** - [same shape]

Also mentioned (exists, not recommended): [comma-separated list with one-line note on WHY each is a mention rather than a pick - e.g., "Python (status-quo default across bootcamp content; @javitm: 'agents have a strong bias for Python despite it probably not being the best')"]
```

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- Leading with the most-mentioned option because it appears most frequently ("Python has 15 mentions so it is #1"). That is counting, not judging.
- Treating every mention equally. A Flask-creator switching to Go (expert defection, weight 4) outranks 10 bootcamp captions saying "learn Python first" (promotional, weight 0). The bootcamp captions do not belong in the ranking at all.
- Collapsing "best for what?" into one leaderboard. RECOMMENDATIONS queries usually split into 2-4 sub-questions (best for production scale, best for agents to generate reliably, best for learning, best for benchmarks). Separate them if the research supports it.
- Ignoring anti-signal quotes. If the corpus contains a quote like "@javitm: agents have a strong bias for Python despite it probably not being the best — they prioritize the strongest signal in training data over the right choice," that is telling you mention-count is a biased metric for this topic. Read it; surface it; do not ignore it.
- Stress-test your top pick before emitting. Ask: "Would the research actually defend this claim to a skeptical expert?" If the answer is no, re-rank.

**Named failure mode (2026-04-18):** On `best programming language for AI agents`, Opus 4.7 led with `🏆 Most mentioned: Python (15+x mentions)` and put Go at #3 with 7x mentions. Model self-debug: "I counted when I should have judged. The single most load-bearing quote in the whole research was @javitm saying agents have a bias for Python despite it probably not being the best. I read that quote and then ranked by mention count anyway. The Flask-creator switching to Go was the real headline; I buried it." Do not repeat this failure.

**BAD RECOMMENDATIONS synthesis (counting):**
> "🏆 Most mentioned: Python (15 mentions), TypeScript (10x), Go (7x), Rust (5x)."

**GOOD RECOMMENDATIONS synthesis (judging):**
> "🏆 Top recommendations (ranked by signal quality, not mention count):
>
> **Go** - Flask creator Miguel Grinberg publicly switched this month for a specific technical reason
> - Evidence: @miguelgrinberg blog post "Why I am moving Python projects to Go for AI agents" — cites reliability and concurrency model; 1.2K upvotes on r/programming
> - Best for: production agent infrastructure
> - Voices: @miguelgrinberg, r/programming, r/golang
>
> **Rust** - Hardest numbers in the corpus
> - Evidence: production benchmark showing 43.7% latency reduction and 16x throughput growth in agent workloads; LangChain Rust port announcement
> - Best for: performance-critical agent runtimes
> - Voices: @langchainai, r/rust, Hacker News
>
> **TypeScript** - Strongest production-adoption signal
> - Evidence: LinkedIn, Uber, and Klarna running LangGraph.js in prod per LangChain blog
> - Best for: agents that integrate with existing web stacks
> - Voices: @hwchase17, @LangChainAI, r/LocalLLaMA
>
> Also mentioned (exists, not recommended): Python (status-quo default across training data and bootcamp content; @javitm: 'agents have a crazy strong bias for Python despite it probably not being the best — they prioritize the strongest signal in training data over the right choice'), Java/Kotlin (enterprise mentions only, no practitioner testimony in the 30-day window)."

Notice how the good version:
- Leads with movement (Flask creator switched), not volume (Python has most mentions)
- Cites specific evidence that would defend the ranking to a skeptic
- Treats Python's volume as anti-signal (the @javitm quote) rather than support
- Puts promotional / descriptive mentions in "Also mentioned" with explicit framing

### If QUERY_TYPE = COMPARISON

**Comparison queries have their OWN synthesis template. Do NOT use the general-query `What I learned:` + bold-lead-in + `KEY PATTERNS:` structure for comparisons.** The comparison template below is the canonical shape proven by the April 9 launch-video exemplar. Follow it section-for-section.

Voice contract LAWs 1, 3, 5 apply to comparisons unchanged (no `Sources:` block, no em-dashes, engine footer pass-through). LAWs 2 and 4 have comparison-specific exceptions (see the LAW block: the comparison title and the five section headers below are REQUIRED, not violations).

**Required comparison structure (match the April 9 exemplar):**

```

# {TOPIC_A} vs {TOPIC_B} [vs {TOPIC_C}]: What the Community Says (/Last30Days)

## Quick Verdict

[One paragraph. Frame the thesis (are these competitors or layers of a stack? who's dominant? who's challenging?). Include scale stats for each entity inline (GitHub stars, user counts, whatever metric is comparable). End with one quotable community framing — a tweet, a Reddit quote, a YouTube clip — that captures how the community sees the relationship.]

## {Entity 1}

**Community Sentiment:** [Positive / Mixed / Negative / Enthusiastic / Security-concerned / etc.] ({N}+ mentions across {source list})

**Strengths (what people love)**
- [Specific strength with `per <source>` attribution]
- [Specific strength with `per <source>` attribution]
- [Specific strength with `per <source>` attribution]

**Weaknesses (common complaints)**
- [Specific complaint with `per <source>` attribution]
- [Specific complaint with `per <source>` attribution]

## {Entity 2}

[Same structure: Community Sentiment, Strengths bullets, Weaknesses bullets]

## {Entity 3}

[Same structure]

## Head-to-Head

| Dimension | {Entity 1} | {Entity 2} | {Entity 3} |
|---|---|---|---|
| What it is | ... | ... | ... |
| GitHub stars | ... | ... | ... |
| Philosophy | ... | ... | ... |
| Skills | ... | ... | ... |
| Memory | ... | ... | ... |
| Models | ... | ... | ... |
| Security | ... | ... | ... |
| Best for | ... | ... | ... |
| Install | ... | ... | ... |

(Engine emits this scaffold; fill the cells with 5-15 words each. If an axis does not apply to the topic class, write "N/A" or a topic-appropriate substitute rather than inventing data.)

## The Bottom Line

**Choose {Entity 1} if** [specific use case, comfort profile, tradeoff]. [One supporting sentence with attribution.]

**Choose {Entity 2} if** [specific use case, comfort profile, tradeoff]. [One supporting sentence with attribution.]

**Choose {Entity 3} if** [specific use case, comfort profile, tradeoff]. [One supporting sentence with attribution.]

## The emerging stack

[One paragraph. Name the combination pattern the community is converging on. Cite specific sources (`per @handle`, `per r/sub`, `per {channel} on YouTube`). This is the synthesis moment of the piece. If the data does not support an emerging-stack observation, write "No emerging stack pattern has crystallized in the research window yet" rather than fabricating one.]

I've compared {TOPIC_A} vs {TOPIC_B} [vs ...] using the latest community data. Some things you could ask:
- [follow-up referencing comparison specifics, e.g. "Deep dive into {Entity} alone with /last30days {Entity}"]
- [follow-up referencing a specific claim from the Strengths/Weaknesses block]
- [follow-up on a specific dimension from the Head-to-Head table]
- [follow-up on the emerging-stack combination pattern]
```

**Do NOT:**
- Use `What I learned:` prose label (that is general-query voice)
- Use bold-lead-in paragraphs with ` - ` separators for the body (that is general-query voice)
- Use a `KEY PATTERNS from the research:` numbered list (replaced by per-entity Strengths/Weaknesses bullets and the emerging-stack paragraph)
- Fabricate a `## Notable Stats` block (the engine footer IS the stats block, LAW 5)
- Produce section headers outside the six listed above (`## Quick Verdict`, `## {Entity}` per entity, `## Head-to-Head`, `## The Bottom Line`, `## The emerging stack` are the only allowed `##` headers per LAW 4 comparison exception)

**Reference exemplar:** `$LAST30DAYS_MEMORY_DIR/openclaw-vs-hermes-vs-paperclip-LAUNCH-VIDEO-april9-exemplar.md` preserves the April 9 canonical output with full structural analysis. Match this shape section-for-section.
