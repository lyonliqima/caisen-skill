### Section A: Resolve X Handles (if topic could have X accounts)

If TOPIC looks like it could have its own X/Twitter account - **people, creators, brands, products, tools, companies, communities** (e.g., "Dor Brothers", "Jason Calacanis", "Nano Banana Pro", "Seedance", "Midjourney"), do WebSearches to find handles in three categories:

**1. Primary handle** (the entity itself):
```
WebSearch("{TOPIC} X twitter handle site:x.com")
```

**2. Company/organization handle OR founder/creator handle** -- This mapping is bidirectional:
- If the topic is a **PERSON**, resolve their company's X handle. A CEO's story is inseparable from their company's story.
- If the topic is a **PRODUCT or COMPANY**, resolve the founder/creator's personal X handle. The creator's personal account often has the most candid, high-signal content.
```
WebSearch("{TOPIC} company CEO of site:x.com")
```
OR for products:
```
WebSearch("{TOPIC} creator founder X twitter site:x.com")
```
Examples: Sam Altman -> @OpenAI, Dario Amodei -> @AnthropicAI, OpenClaw -> @steipete (Peter Steinberger), Paperclip -> @dotta, Claude Code -> @alexalbert__.

**3. 1-2 related handles** -- People/entities closely associated with the topic (spouse, collaborator, band member), PLUS 1-2 prominent commentator/media handles that regularly cover this topic:
```
WebSearch("{RELATED_PERSON_OR_ENTITY} X twitter handle site:x.com")
```
For a music artist, find music commentary accounts (e.g., @PopBase, @HotFreestyle, @DailyRapFacts).
For a tech CEO, find tech media accounts (e.g., @TechCrunch, @TheInformation).
For a product, find reviewer accounts in that category.

From the results, extract their X/Twitter handles. Look for:
- **Verified profile URLs** like `x.com/{handle}` or `twitter.com/{handle}`
- Mentions like "@handle" in bios, articles, or social profiles
- "Follow @handle on X" patterns

**Verify accounts are real, not parody/fan accounts.** Check for:
- Verified/blue checkmark in the search results
- Official website linking to the X account
- Consistent naming (e.g., @thedorbrothers for "The Dor Brothers", not @DorBrosFan)
- If results only show fan/parody/news accounts (not the entity's own account), skip - the entity may not have an X presence

Pass handles to the CLI:
- Primary: `--x-handle={handle}` (without @)
- Related: `--x-related={handle1},{handle2},{company_handle},{commentator_handles}` (comma-separated, without @)

Example for "Kanye West":
- Primary: `--x-handle=kanyewest`
- Related: `--x-related=travisscott,PopBase,HotFreestyle`

Example for "Sam Altman":
- Primary: `--x-handle=sama`
- Related: `--x-related=OpenAI,TechCrunch`

Related handles are searched with lower weight (0.3) so they appear in results but don't dominate over the primary entity's content.

**Note about @grok:** Grok is Elon's AI on X (xAI). It often appears in search results with thoughtful, accurate analysis. When citing @grok in your synthesis, frame it as "per Grok's AI analysis of [article/topic]" rather than treating it as an independent human commentator.

**Skip this step if:**
- TOPIC is clearly a generic concept, not an entity (e.g., "best rap songs 2026", "how to use Docker", "AI ethics debate")
- TOPIC already contains @ (user provided the handle directly)
- Using `--quick` depth
- WebSearch shows no official X account exists for this entity

Store: `RESOLVED_HANDLE = {handle or empty}`, `RESOLVED_RELATED = {comma-separated handles or empty}`

### Step 0.5b: Resolve GitHub Username (if topic is a person) — MANDATORY FOR PERSON TOPICS

**MANDATORY when the topic is a person (developer, creator, CEO, founder, engineer, researcher) and WebSearch is available.** Resolving the X handle but NOT the GitHub handle is the documented Peter Steinberger failure mode (2026-04-18). Without `--github-user={handle}`, GitHub search becomes a keyword match across all of GitHub instead of person-mode scoped to `user:{handle}`. The result is typically 5-10 thin unrelated items instead of the person's actual commits, PRs, releases, and top-starred repos. Treat this as a peer step to Step 0.5 (X handle resolution), not an afterthought.

Do the WebSearch:

```
WebSearch("{TOPIC} github profile site:github.com")
```

From the results, extract their GitHub username from URLs like `github.com/{username}`.

**Verify the account is correct:** Check that the profile description or pinned repos match the person you're researching. Common names may return multiple profiles.

Pass to the CLI: `--github-user={username}` (without @)

Worked examples:
- For "Peter Steinberger", a WebSearch for `Peter Steinberger github profile site:github.com` returns @steipete. Pass `--github-user=steipete`.
- For "Matt Van Horn": `--github-user=mvanhorn`
- For "Garry Tan": `--github-user=garrytan`

**Person-mode GitHub tells a different story than keyword search.** Instead of "who mentioned this person in an issue body," it answers: "What are they shipping? Where are they getting merged? What do their own projects look like?" The engine fetches PR velocity, top repos with star counts, release notes, and README summaries.

**Skip this step if:**
- TOPIC is clearly NOT a person (products, concepts, events)
- TOPIC already has `--github-user` specified by the user
- Using `--quick` depth
- WebSearch shows no GitHub profile for this person (report "no GitHub handle found for this person" and proceed without `--github-user` rather than fabricating one)

Store: `RESOLVED_GITHUB_USER = {username or empty}`

**Checkpoint for person topics:** by the time you reach the Research Execution command, for a person topic you MUST have BOTH `RESOLVED_HANDLE` (from Step 0.5) AND `RESOLVED_GITHUB_USER` (from this step) OR an explicit "no X account" / "no GitHub profile" note. The Bash command that follows must include BOTH `--x-handle={handle}` AND `--github-user={handle}` when resolved. A person-topic run that shows only one of the two is a Step 0.5b regression.

### Step 0.5c: Resolve GitHub Repos (if topic is a product/project)

If TOPIC looks like a product, tool, or open source project (not a person), resolve its GitHub repo for project-mode search:

```
WebSearch("{TOPIC} github repo site:github.com")
```

From the results, extract `owner/repo` from URLs like `github.com/{owner}/{repo}`.

Pass to the CLI: `--github-repo={owner/repo}`

For comparisons ("X vs Y"), resolve repos for both topics: `--github-repo={repo_a},{repo_b}`

Example for "OpenClaw": `--github-repo=openclaw/openclaw`
Example for "OpenClaw vs Paperclip": `--github-repo=openclaw/openclaw,paperclipai/paperclip`

Project-mode GitHub fetches live star counts, README snippets, latest releases, and top issues directly from the API. This is always more accurate than blog posts or YouTube videos citing weeks-old numbers.

**Skip this step if:**
- TOPIC is a person (use `--github-user` instead)
- TOPIC has no GitHub presence (not a software project)
- WebSearch shows no GitHub repo for this topic

Store: `RESOLVED_GITHUB_REPOS = {comma-separated owner/repo or empty}`
