## Research Execution

### PRECONDITION GATE - read before running the script

**STOP. Before invoking `last30days.py`, verify ALL of the following are true for this turn:**

1. **Platform branch chosen.** You know whether this session has WebSearch (Claude Code) or does not (OpenClaw, raw CLI, Codex without web tools).
2. **If WebSearch IS available:** you MUST have run Step 0.55 (Pre-Research Intelligence - resolved subreddits, X handles, TikTok hashtags/creators, Instagram creators, GitHub user/repo where applicable) AND Step 0.75 (Query Planner - produced `QUERY_PLAN_JSON` with 2-4 subqueries). These are NOT optional. If either was skipped, return to that step now.
3. **If WebSearch is NOT available:** you MUST add `--auto-resolve` to the command instead. Do not attempt Steps 0.55 / 0.75 without WebSearch.
4. **The command you are about to run uses `--emit=compact`.** `--emit md` is a debugging/inspection mode and is DISALLOWED as the primary user-facing flow. If you find yourself about to run `--emit md`, stop and switch to `--emit=compact`.
5. **On WebSearch platforms the command MUST include `--plan 'QUERY_PLAN_JSON'`** plus every resolved handle/subreddit/hashtag/creator flag from Step 0.55. Omit only flags whose value was not resolvable.

**Degraded path (missing any of the above on a WebSearch platform) is a known regression shape. It produces bland 4-bullet summaries instead of rich synthesis. Do not take it.**

**Step 1: Run the research script WITH your query plan (FOREGROUND)**

**CRITICAL: Run this command in the FOREGROUND with a 5-minute timeout. Do NOT use run_in_background. The full output contains Reddit, X, AND YouTube data that you need to read completely.**

**IMPORTANT: Pass your QUERY_PLAN_JSON via the --plan flag. This tells the Python script to use YOUR plan instead of calling Gemini.**

**IMPORTANT: Include `--x-handle={RESOLVED_HANDLE}` in the command. For comparison mode: Pass `--x-handle={TOPIC_A_HANDLE}` to the first pass, `--x-handle={TOPIC_B_HANDLE}` to the second pass, and both to the head-to-head pass. Also include `--subreddits={RESOLVED_SUBREDDITS}`, `--tiktok-hashtags={RESOLVED_HASHTAGS}`, `--tiktok-creators={RESOLVED_TIKTOK_CREATORS}`, and `--ig-creators={RESOLVED_IG_CREATORS}` from Step 0.55. Omit any flag where the value was not resolved (empty).**

```bash
# SKILL_DIR = absolute path of the directory containing THIS SKILL.md you just Read.
# Substitute the actual path below — your harness told you where this file lives via
# the Read tool result. Examples:
#   Read ~/.claude/skills/last30days/SKILL.md      → SKILL_DIR=$HOME/.claude/skills/last30days
#   Read ~/.codex/skills/last30days/SKILL.md       → SKILL_DIR=$HOME/.codex/skills/last30days
#   Read ~/.claude/plugins/cache/last30days-skill/last30days/3.3.1/skills/last30days/SKILL.md
#     → SKILL_DIR=$HOME/.claude/plugins/cache/last30days-skill/last30days/3.3.1/skills/last30days
# scripts/last30days.py is always a direct child of SKILL_DIR (every install layout
# packages SKILL.md and scripts/ as siblings).
SKILL_DIR="<absolute path of the directory containing the SKILL.md you Read>"

if [ ! -f "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/last30days.py" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: scripts/last30days.py not found under SKILL_DIR=$SKILL_DIR" >&2
  echo "Re-check the directory of the SKILL.md you Read and substitute it as SKILL_DIR above." >&2
  exit 1
fi

"${LAST30DAYS_PYTHON}" "${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/last30days.py" $ARGUMENTS --emit=compact --save-dir="${LAST30DAYS_MEMORY_DIR}" --save-suffix=v3
```

**If you ran Steps 0.55 and 0.75 (agent planning), pass the plan via a tmpfile and add the targeting flags:**

```bash
# Write QUERY_PLAN_JSON to a tmpfile before the engine invocation above.
# parse_plan() reads file paths transparently; this avoids inline-JSON
# shell-quoting hazards (apostrophes in search_query / ranking_query
# strings break single-quoted command-line JSON). Trailing XXXXXX (no
# .json suffix) for BSD/macOS portability — BSD mktemp only substitutes
# X's at the end of the template.
QUERY_PLAN_FILE=$(mktemp "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/last30days-plan.XXXXXX")
trap 'rm -f "$QUERY_PLAN_FILE"' EXIT
cat > "$QUERY_PLAN_FILE" <<'PLAN_EOF'
{QUERY_PLAN_JSON_FROM_STEP_0.75}
PLAN_EOF
```

Then add to the engine command:

- `--plan "$QUERY_PLAN_FILE"` (path to the file you just wrote)
- `--x-handle={RESOLVED_HANDLE}` (from Step 0.5)
- `--subreddits={RESOLVED_SUBREDDITS}` (from Step 0.55)
- `--tiktok-hashtags={RESOLVED_HASHTAGS}` (from Step 0.55)
- `--tiktok-creators={RESOLVED_TIKTOK_CREATORS}` (from Step 0.55)
- `--ig-creators={RESOLVED_IG_CREATORS}` (from Step 0.55)
- `--github-user={RESOLVED_GITHUB_USER}` (from Step 0.5b, person topics only)
- `--github-repo={RESOLVED_GITHUB_REPOS}` (from Step 0.5c, product/project topics only)
- Omit any flag where the value was not resolved (empty).

**If you skipped Steps 0.55 and 0.75 (no WebSearch -- OpenClaw, Codex, etc.), add:**
- `--auto-resolve` (the engine will use Brave/Exa/Serper to discover subreddits and context before planning)

**If you skipped Steps 0.55 and 0.75 (no WebSearch), run the command as-is.** The Python engine will plan internally.

Use a **timeout of 300000** (5 minutes) on the Bash call. The script typically takes 1-3 minutes.

The script will automatically:
- Detect available API keys
- Run Reddit/X/YouTube/TikTok/Instagram/Hacker News/Polymarket searches
- Output ALL results including YouTube transcripts, TikTok captions, Instagram captions, HN comments, and prediction market odds

**Read the ENTIRE output.** It contains EIGHT data sections in this order: Reddit items, X items, YouTube items, TikTok items, Instagram Reels items, Hacker News items, Polymarket items, and WebSearch items. If you miss sections, you will produce incomplete stats.

**YouTube items in the output look like:** `**{video_id}** (score:N) {channel_name} [N views, N likes]` followed by a title, URL, **transcript highlights** (pre-extracted quotable excerpts from the video), and an optional full transcript in a collapsible section. **Quote the highlights directly in your synthesis.** When YouTube items also include top comments (enabled via `youtube_comments`), quote those too with their like counts - they capture how viewers reacted to the video. Transcript highlights and top comments are complementary signals; use both when present. Attribute transcript quotes to the channel name, comment quotes to the commenter. Count them and include them in your synthesis and stats block.

**TikTok items in the output look like:** `**{TK_id}** (score:N) @{creator} [N views, N likes]` followed by a caption, URL, hashtags, and optional caption snippet. Count them and include them in your synthesis and stats block.

**Instagram Reels items in the output look like:** `**{IG_id}** (score:N) @{creator} (date) [N views, N likes]` followed by caption text, URL, and optional transcript. Count them and include them in your synthesis and stats block. Instagram provides unique creator/influencer perspective - weight it alongside TikTok.
