## Step 0.45: Query Quality Pre-Flight (detect keyword-trap topics BEFORE running the engine)

**MANDATORY. Before Step 0.5, diagnose the topic for known failure classes. If the topic is a keyword trap, reframe or ask a clarifying question BEFORE calling the engine. Running the engine on a doomed query burns 5+ minutes and produces junk. Detecting the trap upfront costs one turn.**

Known keyword-trap classes and how to handle each:

**Class 1: Demographic shopping query**
- Pattern: `gift for {age} year old {gender}`, `what to buy for my {relationship}`, `present for {demographic}`, `birthday gift for {age} {gender}`.
- Why it fails: no human on Reddit posts "I bought a 42 year old man a gift." Real posts use relationship + hobbies + budget. The literal phrase is not the vocabulary of the actual discussions. The 2026-04-18 "Birthday gift for 42 year old man" run returned r/todayilearned, r/japannews crime posts, r/LivestreamFail drama - none about gifts.
- Action: **Ask ONE clarifying question upfront**:
  > "Before I research, tell me a bit more - hobbies (cooks / runs / reads / gaming / outdoors / golf / music)? Relationship (husband / dad / friend / boss / brother)? Budget range? A 'gift for a 42 year old man' is a wide net; hobbies + relationship narrow it 10x."
- If the user declines to narrow ("just run it"), reframe to generic-demographic and scope to gift subreddits:
  - Drop the literal age (age 42 reads identically to 41 or 43 in social content; the number causes keyword collisions like Jackie Robinson #42)
  - Rewrite as `gifts for men in their 40s` or `gifts for men who [hobby]`
  - Scope `--subreddits=GiftIdeas,BuyItForLife,AskMen,malefashionadvice,Dads` (plus hobby-specific subs when known)
  - Note in the Resolved block: "Reframed demographic shopping query. Dropping literal age; scoping to gift communities."

**Class 2: Numeric / age keyword trap**
- Pattern: topic contains a specific number that collides with unrelated content (42 = Jackie Robinson + Hitchhiker's + a 42" quilt; 40 = 40th anniversary posts; 50 = state-count posts; 100 = bench-press posts).
- Why it fails: the number dominates retrieval and pulls in unrelated content. A search that prominently features "42" returns jersey-number posts; a search for "the 100" returns TV-show posts.
- Action: Strip the number from the engine search query unless it is semantically load-bearing (e.g., "GPT-4" yes, "40 year old man" no, "Area 51" yes, "top 10 foods" no). Keep the number in the user's original framing for context; drop it from the engine query. Document in Resolved: "Dropping '{number}' from the search query - it is a keyword trap that pulls in unrelated content. Search will cover the concept generically."

**Class 3: Overly-literal concept phrase**
- Pattern: `how to use X`, `what is Y`, `tutorial for Z`, `explain A` — tutorial-shaped phrasing where social posts are in different vocabulary.
- Why it fails: social posts about Docker do not say "how to use Docker"; they say "my Docker setup", "nginx in Docker", "my dev loop", "tip for folks using Docker Compose". Tutorial phrasing matches blog titles, not social discussions.
- Action: Reframe from tutorial phrasing to discussion phrasing: "how to use Docker" becomes "Docker tips tricks workflows" or "Docker production setups". Document the reframe in the Resolved block.

**Class 4: Generic single-noun common word**
- Pattern: topic is a single common noun with no specific hook (`bread`, `sneakers`, `coffee`, `shoes`, `headphones`).
- Why it fails: single-noun queries have no anchor — the corpus is infinite and the signal is noise.
- Action: Ask for specificity before running:
  > "{TOPIC} is a huge category - are you asking about {specific-facet-A}, {specific-facet-B}, or {specific-facet-C}? Each is a different community. Pick one or tell me the angle."

**Pre-Flight decision flow (do this BEFORE any WebSearch):**
1. Read the topic. Match against Classes 1-4 above.
2. If the topic matches a class, ALWAYS emit a visible pre-flight note before the Resolved block:
   - `Pre-Flight: topic matches {Class N} ({class name}). {Action: clarifying question / reframe / specificity ask}.`
3. If the action is a clarifying question, STOP after emitting it. Wait for the user response before any engine work.
4. If the topic does NOT match any class, emit a one-liner: `Pre-Flight: topic is a {named-entity / comparison / concept} - proceeding to Step 0.5.` Then proceed.

**One-turn gate rule:** do NOT run the engine on a keyword-trap topic without either (a) explicit user confirmation to "just run it anyway", or (b) a concrete reframed query. Burning 5 minutes on a doomed run is worse than a one-turn clarifying question.

**When the user provides context inline:** if a Class 1 query already contains hobbies/relationship/budget ("gift for my cooking-obsessed husband, $200"), SKIP the clarifying question and go straight to the reframe + scope action. The clarifying question exists to fill in the gaps; if the gaps are already filled, move on.

## Step 0.5: Pre-Flight Resolution (handles, repos, communities)

**Pre-Flight Checklist — do NOT stop after the first flag. Every applicable flag below is MANDATORY for its topic class.**

Before running the engine, determine which flags apply to this topic and resolve them. Reading only the "X handle" subsection and stopping there is the named failure mode of the Peter Steinberger disaster #2 (2026-04-18). The model admitted on debug: "I treated the 'X handle resolution' section as the full contract for pre-flight resolution and didn't --help the script to see what else existed." The checklist below IS the full contract.

| Flag | Resolved in | Applies when |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `--x-handle={handle}` | Step 0.5 (Section A below) | Topic is a person, brand, product, or creator with an X presence |
| `--x-related={h1,h2,...}` | Step 0.5 (Section A below) | Topic has associated entities (founders, commentators, spouse, collaborators, media handles) |
| `--github-user={user}` | Step 0.5b | Topic is a person who ships code (developer, engineer, CEO-who-codes, researcher) |
| `--github-repo={owner/repo}` | Step 0.5c | Topic is a product / project / open-source tool |
| `--subreddits={sub1,sub2,...}` | Step 0.55 | Always — almost every topic has active Reddit communities |
| `--tiktok-hashtags={h1,h2,...}` | Step 0.55 | Always — inferred from topic |
| `--tiktok-creators={c1,c2,...}` | Step 0.55 | Creator / influencer / brand topics |
| `--ig-creators={c1,c2,...}` | Step 0.55 | Creator / brand topics |
| `--auto-resolve` | Fallback | WebSearch is available but Step 0.55 could not resolve everything cleanly — use as belt-and-suspenders |

**Checkpoint before running the engine:** your Bash command must include every flag from the checklist that applies to this topic. For a person who ships code (the Peter Steinberger class), that is MINIMUM `--x-handle` AND `--github-user` AND `--subreddits`, and typically `--x-related` too. A command with only `--x-handle` on a person topic is a pre-flight skip and a Step 0.5 regression.
